;;; Commentary:

;; This package warns you when a local repository is in a state that
;; needs to be changed before quitting emacs. For example, it is able
;; to warn you when there are some unpushed commits or if the
;; repository is dirty. The functions of the form `vc-git-check-*-p'
;; perform the check. The checks are controlled in two ways: The
;; buffer-local variable `vc-git-check' specifies the checks to
;; perform. If it is not set, the associative list
;; `vc-git-check-alist' is looked into.
